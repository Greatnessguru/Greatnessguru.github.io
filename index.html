<li>p.14-15, "[59] ... the Defendants were under a duty or duties described in<br>
... the Criminal Code of Canada to continue to provide the vitamin/mineral<br>
micronutrient treatment and to maintain the support program or<br>
possibly face the consequences of being charged with criminal negligence. ...<br>
Further, the Defendants argued that it was established law<br>
that it was no defence to charges of criminal negligence<br>
to say that one had to cause harm<br>
because one had to comply with licensing requirement."</li>
<li>p.11, "[43] ... As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada ...:<br>
'... a liberal and humane criminal law cannot<br>
hold people to the strict obedience of laws<br>
in emergency situations where normal human instincts, ...,<br>
overwhelmingly compel disobedience.'"</li>
<li>Q: Was Health Canada (Canada's "FDA") themselves<br>
perhaps guilty of committing Criminal Negligence in 2003?</li>
<li>Q: Are Health care facilities and practitioners in either<br>
Canada or the USA perhaps guilty of committing Criminal Negligence Today<br>
if they refuse to competently and knowledgably begin practicing<br>
(micro)Nutritional Psychiatry immediately Without Waiting for<br>
(micro)Nutritional Psychiatry to have a Strong legal basis?</li>

<ul>
<li>Strong legal basis in Canada, but a</li>
<li>Weak legal basis in the USA?</li>

<li>Q: Did the Canadian laws pertaining to Criminal Negligence in 2003<br>
have a Strong Enough legal basis to Prevent, in the First Place,<br>
Health Canada themselves from perhaps committing Criminal Negligence in 2003?</li>
<li>Q: Do the laws pertaining to Criminal Negligence Today in either<br>
Canada or the USA have a Strong Enough legal basis to Prevent, in the First Place,<br>

<p>This author, with the above, has made obvious the, "Emperors' New Clothes":<br>
“Remember, it's better to build a fence at the top of the cliff<br>
than a hospital at the bottom.”  </p>

<p>By building a Strong Enough fence (Strong Enough Criminal Negligence legal basis),<br>
you Prevent the committing of Criminal Negligence in the First Place, Ever Again!  </p>

<p>The Weak legal basis of Criminal Negligence and Professional Competencies in Psychiatry<br>
(including, but not limited to, "Scientific Orientation" and "Systems Thinking")<br>
are the "Broken Fences" ("New Clothes"). <a href="http://www.asppb.net/resource/resmgr/Guidelines/ASPPB_Competencies_Expected_.pdf">ASPPB Competencies Expected of Psychologists</a>  </p>

<p>Our problematic and dysfunctional Medical and Legal Systems ("Emperors")<br>
